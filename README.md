Hi, I am @davermurray

I am a student at the University of Arizona - working on MODFLOW and Machine learning models. Interested in the ways ML models can improve on physically based models. Also interested
in using them to extract information from data - see if we really need to collect all that data or is knowledge we seek already there (we just need the tools to access it).
